#Project <br>
CryptoFy is a virtual reality platform for brokers and traders of cryptocurrency and stocks. The VR Interface allows traders 
to have a dynamic multi-screen experience from anywhere in the world.
The VR experience gives users a panorama of different screens simulating a virtual trading platform. The broker uses the trading Center to send messages to buyers and sellers when authorization or sending notifications are appropriate. This project is the Intellectual property of Dylan Rosario.
