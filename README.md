#Project <br>
CryptoFy is a virtual reality platform for brokers and traders of cryptocurrency and stocks. The VR Interface allows traders 
to have a dynamic multi-screen experience from anywhere in the world.
The VR experience gives users a panorama of different screens showing client profiles, predictions from machine learning 
algorithm, news, portfolios, and a Trading Center for buying and selling. The broker uses the Trading Center to send messages 
to buyers and sellers when authorization or sending notifications are appropriate. This project is the Intellectual property 
of Dylan Rosario. The code is not shown to protect the work in progress.
